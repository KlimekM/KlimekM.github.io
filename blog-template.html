How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

Wireframing and creating an HTML page with a pair was fairly simple. We were both very flexible and wanted to have seperate designs, but did manage to bounce ideas off of each other and have a similar skeleton for both our wireframe and HTML page template.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I definitely found wireframing to be helpful to my development process. Without a wireframe I would have no idea where to begin my site design.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 

My pair and I decided that a good wireframe for our individual blog posts would have a header which would be consistent with our webpage, but include the individual blog title. Underneath the header we would include a section with the individual blog post and links to each blog entry in the left column.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

I found a cool resource that details the semantic elements in HTML5. The URL for it is "http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp". It was really useful to find out what <nav> is and realize that I can use that to share the links to other blog posts. IN addition to nav, I read about the <article> element which seems ideal for blog posts.
