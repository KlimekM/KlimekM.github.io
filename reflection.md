**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned a lot about CSS padding, borders, and margins by doing this challenge. Prior to doing some research I used padding as if it were a margin and did not realize what it did to a given element. After the research I was able to use a padding-bottom command to add some space between my last line in a blog post and the footer. I also learned how to implement borders more effectively and how to change the border elements.

**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

This challenge gave me a greater understanding of CSS positioning. I was clueless on how absolute and relative positions functioned, but feel like I have a better grasp now. I now realize that absolute positioning is in relation to an element's parent. I was also able to implement a lot of fixed positioning and how I can make elements stay in a given spot on a website.

**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

The easiest aspects of the design were the color and fonts. I had no difficulty implementing those and got it done rather quickly.
The most difficult aspect for me was definitely padding and margins. I started using padding as opposed to a margin which completely changed the look of my page. 

**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

One thing that I learned about formatting elements in CSS is how to make certain text appear lighter than normal. It was good to play around with the formatting and see how it works on an actual live webpage.
