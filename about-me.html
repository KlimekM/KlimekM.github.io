    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>
    I am a web developer with a passion for problem solving. I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp, a 19 week fully immersive coding bootcamp, and am currently searching for my first job as a developer. I am from Chicago, IL and love living here. Prior to Dev Bootcamp, I received a Bachelor's of Science in Kinesiology from the University of Illinois at Chicago.

    <p>
    Some of my interests include playing volleyball/basketball, watching the NBA (Go Bulls!), hip-hop, and drinking lots of delicious craft beer! I try to maintain an active lifestyle, love spending time with my family/friends, and I am always open to trying new things.
    </p>
    <p>
    A quirky fact about me is that I am obsessed with bananas and eat at least 2 per day.
