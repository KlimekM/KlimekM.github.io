    <p>I am a web developer with a passion for problem solving. I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp, a 19 week fully immersive coding bootcamp, and am currently searching for my first job as a developer. I am from Chicago, IL and love living here. Prior to Dev Bootcamp, I received a Bachelor's of Science in Kinesiology from the University of Illinois at Chicago.</p>
    <p>Some of my interests include playing volleyball/basketball, watching the NBA (Go Bulls!), hip-hop, and drinking craft beer! I try to maintain an active lifestyle, love spending time with my family/friends, and I am always open to trying new things.</p>
    <p>A quirky fact about me is that I am obsessed with bananas and eat at least 2 per day.</p>
    <p>If you would like to get to know me some more or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out via e-mail at mklimek15@gmail.com or via the social media links at the bottom of this page.</p>
