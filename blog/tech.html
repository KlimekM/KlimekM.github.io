    <h1>Ruby on Rails!</h1>
    <h2>What it is and how it works</h2>
    <h4>January 10, 2016</h4>
    <p>
    This week I looked into Rails and what exactly it is. Before beginning Dev Bootcamp I would constantly hear the term Ruby on Rails and had no idea what exactly it meant. I knew that Ruby was the coding language that we would focus on, but I had little to no knowledge of Rails and how it relates to Ruby. After some light research I will attempt to introduce you to Rails and help you understand how it works with Ruby.
    </p>
    <p>
    Rails is a web application framework that is designed to work with the computer programming language Ruby. This is why Rails is commonly referred to as Ruby on Rails and the terms are sort of interchangeable. Before I confuse you any further, a web application framework is in essence a blueprint for an application to work on the internet. Without Rails our Ruby code would literally print on the screen so if we were to write <code>puts "Ruby is great"</code> without a framework it would literally write the entire line with the puts included. Rails allows us to use Ruby to write specific web applications so that when we type that same piece of code in we simply return Ruby is great.
    </p>
    <p>
    The reason a web application framework like Rails is so important is because without it we literally can not make a functioning web application using Ruby. There are other frameworks that work with Ruby, but Rails is by far the most popular one of them all. Some major components or talking points of Rails are that it pushes the DRY philosophy which means Don't Repeat Yourself and it promotes convention over configuration. The DRY philosophy is essential, because it helps cut down on repetitive code and the convention over configuration reaches into the Rails library and defaults to a set conventions without requiring the user to configure each individual file.
    </p>
    <p>
    Hopefully I was able to provide you with a brief introduction to Rails. The TL;DR version of my post: Rails is a web application framework that is designed to work with the computer programming language Ruby. Cheers!
