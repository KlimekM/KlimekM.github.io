    <h1>Week 1 of Dev Bootcamp</h1>
    <h2>And so it begins..</h2>
    <h4>November 13, 2015</h4>
    <section>
      <p>
      This week marked the start of my journey through Dev Bootcamp as I began phase 0. After some struggles initially I have finally gotten my feet wet and seem to be slowly getting the hang of things. As a beginner in the coding world I want to explain some of the concepts that I learned during this first week and some of their benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
      One of the main concepts that was introduced in week 1 was version control. Version control is a system that allows you to create save points of a given file over time. You can then access these save points or versions of the file later and see the changes and additions that were made at that moment. The benefits of version control include the ability to restore previous versions of a file, determining how a change or addition was executed, and the ability to show others how you created a file or program.
      </p>
      <p>
      Git is one of the more popular version control management systems. It helps keep track of your changes through a set of git commands that can be run from your command terminal. These commands can provide information on your current file status and commit any changes by creating a save point. The "git commit -m" command is essential for tracking changes and allows you to attach a message to the save that details what changes were made to the file.
      </p>
      <p>
      Git tracks changes to your local computer, but what happens if you want to access a file remotely? That is where the program GitHub comes in. GitHub is essentially an online database that you can use to store your code. The best part about using Github is that you can push your local files and projects to/from the online system. You can then access your project from any computer by navigating to the GitHub website. Another benefit to using GitHub is the ability to create branches or working copies of your code which you can work on and integrate back into the master file without worrying about harming the original file. 
      </p>   
      <p>
      I hope that I was able to briefly introduce the topics of version control, git, and GitHub. All of these concepts can be discussed in further detail and are only some of the concepts that were covered during week 1 of phase 0. I encourage everyone to research all three in further detail as they are all essential tools in the programming world.
      </p>
      <p>
      Happy Coding!
